      "Different meanings can be found in Bill's international names: His English, German, Dutch, and Russian name, Bill (RUS: Билла), is a hypocorism of the Germanic name William . William is closely related to Wilhelm , both meaning \"vehement protector\" due to their Proto-Germanic roots *wiljô \"will\" and *helmaz \"helmet; protection\". Bill may also be an alternative or regionalization of Βασίλ (Basíl), a similar hypocorism of the Greek name Βασίλειος (Basíleios \"Vasileios\", meaning \"royal\", or \"kingly\"). In English, Bill also doubles as a pun, as bill is the common term for the beaks of ducks and other aquatic birds. This joke is lost in translation (DEU: Schnabel , DUT: snavel , RUS: клюв (kljuv)). His Chinese and Japanese names (CHN: 皮蛋 Pídàn , JPN: ピータン Pītan ) are the native name and a transliteration respectively for Century eggs . Literally meaning \"preserved egg\", pídàn is a Chinese egg-based culinary dish made by preserving duck, chicken, or quail eggs in a mixture of clay, ash, salt, quicklime, and rice hulls for several weeks to several months, depending on the method of processing. This oriental namesake is reflected in his home furniture. His Italian name, Gino , is a hypocorism of several names, such as Ambrogino, Eugenio, and Luigino. The diminutive is ultimately rooted in the Ancient Greek γένος (génos, \"born\"). Tying into his Jock personality, Gino is also common name of renowned athletes, namely football players. His Spanish name, Paquito , is an affectionate diminutive of Paco , a derivative of Francisco (cognate to Francis \"Frenchman\", possibly rooted in PGe. *frankô \"javelin\"). His name may also be a pun on the Spanish word for ducks, pato , which it is alliterative and shares spelling with. His name may be a reference to Anderson Pinheiero , Juliano Pescarolo , and/or Francisco García , professional football players nicknamed \"Paquito\". His French name, Choco , is a clipping of the Spanish chocolate (borrowed from Nahuatl chocolātl , presumably from chocol \"hot\" and ātl \"water\"). This in relation to his reddish-brown plumage and its resemblance to the color of chocolate. His Korean name, 코코아 Kokoa , is a transliteration of the English cocoa (a doublet of the Spanish cacao , itself from Nahuatl cacahuātl ) synecdoche for Theobroma cacao , its bean harvest, and related products. Similar to his French name, Kokoa is self-indicative of his feather color. Most of his regional names are diminutives or hypocorisms, which are often used to invoke a sense of small size or youth. This may be to reflect his short stature as a duck villager .",
      "He shares his birthday with Rover . They both have their birthdays on February 1 st . He also shares his birthday with Bradbury Robinson Jr. (1884-1949), who was (among his many accolades) a pioneer in American football player. Robinson was the first person in the sport to perform a legal forward pass as well as become recognized as a \" triple threat man \", excelling at running, passing, and kicking.",

      "Different meanings can be found in Nosegay's international names, often relating to plants or noses or ants in some way. The word \"nosegay\" often used to refer to a bouquet. Her English name, Nosegay , is the modern spelling of the Middle English word nōsegai . An equivalent of nose + gay (as in \"happy; joyful; lively\"), a nosegay is a small, fragrant bouquet, often worn or carried as an accessory. Gay itself is an English unisex name that has since fallen from popular use in present times. Her Japanese name アリンコ ( Arinko ? ) might be a portmanteau of Japanese words 蟻 ( ari \"ant\" ? ) or 蟻 食 ( arikui \"anteater\" ? ) and the feminine name リンコ ( Rinko ? ) spelled in katakana. Her French name, Tamara , is a variant of the feminine Hebrew name Tamar (תָּמָר‎ tamár , literally \"date palm; date fruit; ( Phoenix dactylifera )\"). Her Spanish name, Marisa , is a contraction of the names Maria and Luisa , the Spanish equivalents to English Mary (from Latin maris \"of the sea\") and Louise (Proto-Germanic *hlūdaz \"loud, famous\" + *wīgą \"battle\"). Her German name, Hortense , is a French feminine given name from Latin hortensia , another name for flowers of the genus Hydrangea . Hortensia , a neuter plural of hortensis , derives from the word hortus , meaning \"garden\". Her Italian name, Narica , is likely a portmanteau of the feminine given name Marica (origin uncertain; name of a Roman nymph who birthed Latinus, the son of the faun chieftain Faunus) and the feminine noun narice \"nostril\" (from L. nāris , itself from nāsus ). It is also the species nomenclature of the white-nosed coati ( Nausa narica ), a mammal from a taxonomic order entirely separate from anteaters. Her Chinese name, Xiǎo Yǐ (小蚁, from localization by iQue) literally means \"little ant\", which is a likely reference to the diet of real anteaters. This can be inferred by inspecting the Han characters of her name: 小 xiǎo is a prefix that general means \"small; tiny; little\", but can also mean \"brief; for a short time\", \"young\" or \"youngest\". 蚁 yǐ can be shorthand for \"ant\", but may also to describe something as \"humble; inconsiderable\" or \"black\", or to refer to foam or sediment in wine. It can also be a surname.",

      "According to her e-Card , Nosegay likes to leave candy and rotten radishes around as bait to attract ants so she can eat them.",

He has half-closed, blue eyes with a dark brown, mask-like patch of fur around them. The tip of his nose, paws, tail, and ears are dark brown.\nFrom Animal Forest through City Folk , as the town's shop owner, he will wear different uniforms for each upgrade of his store.\nFor Nook's Cranny , he wears a blue apron with his leaf symbol on it (in Animal Forest , it is the kanji 店 (ten?), meaning \"shop\"). The blue apron is inferred to be for modesty, referencing the legends of tanuki. This apron appears to be his most iconic outfit. For Nook 'N' Go , he wears a blue, orange, and white-striped shirt and pillbox hat (in Animal Forest , this uniform was red, green, and white). For Nookway , he wears a white apron with a purple leaf and green details on it (blue and orange in Animal Forest ). For Nookington's , he wears a bright blue suit jacket and a pink tie. For the lottery , he wears a red, white, and blue apron and sports visor. In Animal Forest , this was a red and black haori in addition to his usual apron, and a white hachimaki tied around his head.\nIn New Leaf , Nook wears a white shirt with a red necktie and a green argyle sweater vest over it. His sweater has a left-sided pocket protector with a pen sticking out. He also wears black pants. Whenever outside of Nook's Homes , such as the player selecting their new home spot or at The Roost , Nook is seen with a yellow jacket over his sweater.\nIn Happy Home Designer , if his house is designed, the player can visit him and find him in casual wear. He wears a white polo shirt with his leaf logo on it and khaki pants.\nTom Nook makes an appearance in Pocket Camp ; however, he is merely a special furniture item. He also appears on the 1,200 Leaf Ticket GUI.\nIn New Horizons , he now wears a white and teal Hawaiian-style shirt and khaki shorts.

Ursala may get along with jock villagers who share her love of sports, lazy and normal villagers for how laid-back they are, and peppy villagers.
